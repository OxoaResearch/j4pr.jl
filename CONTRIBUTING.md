Hi. If you're reading this, you may be considering contributing to j4pr. Unfortunately, contributing is not yet possible from a practical standpoint. 
This should however not constitute or discourage you from experimenting and modifying j4pr in any way you seem fit. I had no time to formalize
any style or contribution guidelines but it's in the works. Until then, Happy hacking!
